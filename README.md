SASplashScreen
==============

SASplashScreen is a class to easily show a splash screen in your applications, after the original launch image is hidden, which will disappear after a delay.  You can show either the default image, a custom image, a custom imageview animation, or a video.

This class is very simple and only provides the most basic of functionality to show a splash screen.  Please feel free to customize the class as much as you'd like, or use any of the code within your projects.
